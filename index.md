My name is Fritjof and I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at Lund University. You can read more about my programme [here](http://www.lth.se/utbildning/datateknik300/) (in Swedish).

I don't really know what to put here yet but as time passes I guess I'll think of something.

Yours sincerely,
Fritjof
